              Of course, what we are trying to do is to provide a decentralized messaging and video communication system for all blockchain projects who has build-in DID and asymmetric cryptographic algorithm and library.
              Todat major blockchain application is at very early stage and it can only be used in browser with METAMASK wallet or in wallet, the massive adoption should be in mobile.
              The infrastruct for mobile communication is still missing and there are many prolem to solve to bring blokchian to mobile.
