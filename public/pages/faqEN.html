            <div class="question-title">What is the difference？</div>
            <div class="question-answer">
              Gaving up the database based username/password account system, BeagleDAO app uses the address system of blockchain, no more registration is need,
              anyone can prove his ownership of the address just by signing with the private key of that address.
              No one can disable your account or monitor your communication.

            <div class="question-title">Does BeagleDAO support group chat or multiple parties communication？</div>
            <div class="question-answer">
              Yes and even better. The group chat of wechat is not very efficient and there are many spam information. We can improve it in the following area：
              <ul>
                <li>The qualification of join the group can be written in smart contract: it could be free or paid, or it must be with KYC, visitor may or may not be allowed to join;</li>
                <li>The right to send message: anonymous, paid by token；</li>
                <li>unlimited group member；</li>
                <li>display historical message；</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </li>
          <hr>


          <li>
            <div class="question-title">API？</div>
            <div class="question-answer">
              Of course, what we are trying to do is to provide a decentralized messaging and video communication system for all blockchain projects who has build-in DID and asymmetric cryptographic algorithm and library.
              Todat major blockchain application is at very early stage and it can only be used in browser with METAMASK wallet or in wallet, the massive adoption should be in mobile.
              The infrastruct for mobile communication is still missing and there are many prolem to solve to bring blokchian to mobile.
