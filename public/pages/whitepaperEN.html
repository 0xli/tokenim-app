              There are many privacy and security related concerns and problems of today's most used instant messenger and social network software：
            <ul class="item-list">
              <li>Security: The platform or the hackers can get the call log or even the content;</li>
              <li>Privacy: a lot of spam advertise information;</li>
              <li>Interconnection: most no communication between platforms;</li>
            </ul>

          </li>
            <p>
              When it come to trading and business it becomes especially important. Just as Oracle places an important role in the defi ecosystem, cross chain messaging and real time communication will be more critical. In blockchain community we still use centralized messaging and social network such as twitter,facebook, to communicate. It should be changed. 。
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
              This project is to build a real time video communication network based on the technologies and infrastructure found and available in most blockchain projects such as peer to peer network, smart contract. Interview will serve the blockchain community as a cross chain instant messaging platform. It is an real time communication system with most features founded in today's instant messenger. No registration is needed before use it, any one with any DID can make use of it just by sign with the private key only belong to him. It will not be owned or controlled by any person or organization.

              Here are the goal of this project::
              <br />
              <ul class="item-list">
                <li>No registration, no account name and password; DID and signature is the way to authenticate and authorization;</li>
                <li>No server, no database super user; the service is powered by nodes running by miners and all data are encrypted;</li>
                <li>No spam; </li>
              </ul>
            </p>

              <br />
              <ul class="item-list">
            <li>Node/mining software: include messaging relay, offline notification, offline store;</li>
            <li>Client software: IOS and Android app, web;</li>
            <li>SDK: for wallet and other software to easily integrated;</li>
            <li>Billing: smart contract, ERC20 tokens;</li>
              </ul>
            </p>
