#1. metamask support
- login in by sign with metamask (maybe other ethereum main or test chain, 
but it will conntent to our own whisper blockchain and we could give him some EHT of our own private chain)
## UI
- name
- email address (option)
## smart contract
- register: eth address, whisper related information(how to get): id, public and private key
- query for myself:
## ENS register
- option: register and publish name (using ENS api)
## login/listen whisper message
- public message
## call/answer
- should be able to call other club user or metamask 

#2. ENS name end with .club
- current .fax
